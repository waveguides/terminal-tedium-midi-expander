# Terminal Tedium Midi Expander

This module is specifically designed to sit next to, and expand the, [Terminal Tedium](https://github.com/mxmxmx/terminal_tedium) by [mxmxmx](https://github.com/mxmxmx). Together with the Terminal Tedium you will be allowed to have voltage control over MIDI generators.

At the heart this module is a MIDI expander for the Raspberry Pi. The module runs on the [Teensy-LC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html) using the [Arduino MIDI Library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library). The schematic is pretty much the same as recommended by [Paul Stoffregen (PJRC)](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html).

Enjoy,
